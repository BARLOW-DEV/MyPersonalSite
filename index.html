      <h2>Hello.</h2>
      <p>I began to learn to code when I was 35 years old. Since then I have used my
        interest in technology and passion for learning new things to expand my coding and IT skillset. </p>

        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p class="Languages-text">My passion for coding allows me to combine logic and creativity
          to produce useful and valuable tools in a digital world. Creating effective and user-focused software applications
          is currently one of the fastest growing job markets in the world today. By keeping up to date with relevant, modern technologies,
          I will be able to provide my customers with the software that will ensure they stay a step ahead of the competition. </p>

        <h3>Java</h3>
        <p class="java-description">Java isn't the first language that I've learned, but it is the language I have become the
          most familiar. Java, although a simple laguage, can be very powerful due to the accompanying
         Java API which includes several thousand classes. Coupled with a good framework such as Spring,
       Java can be the language of choice for many modern business needs.</p>

      <h3>Pictures of my coral reef saltwater aquarium.</h3>
      <p>I got into the reef tank hobby by trying to find something that would
        look good on top of my old TV stand. I though, "hey, a fish tank would look good on there."
        I knew absolutely nothing about taking care of a fish tank. I soon found saltwater aquariums and have
        been hooked ever since.</p>
